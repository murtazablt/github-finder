## How did I build that project?
Brad Traversy from "React Front to Back 2022" Udemy Course provided the design and idea and I wrote the whole code by using React, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI.

## What problem does gitFinder solve?
GitFinder provides a service for the users, which they can search for a Github User and visit his profile page.

## What did I learn?
That's my first project that I used TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, so the biggest contribution of that project to me is learning how use TailWindCSS and DaisyUI.

## What makes myproject stand out?
GitFinder provides a simple and clean user interface with only information that you need for finding GitHub users, so there is less distraction than the original github page.
